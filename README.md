# ha_bm2monitor
A BM2 battery monitor custom integration

<Work in Progress>
Discovers BM2 battery monitor devices and creates sensors based on battery voltage, percentage and general state via explicit connection rather than BLE broadcast.
  
With thanks to @KrystianD for his reverse-engineering of the BM2 data flow, @fuatakgun for 'Generic Bluetooth' and @msp1974 for 'HAIntegrationExamples'
